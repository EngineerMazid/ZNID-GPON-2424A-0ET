# ZNID-GPON-2424A-0ET

This repository provides information about the ZNID-GPON-2424A-0ET router, which is customized by Etisalat UAE.

## Device Overview
* Model: ZNID-GPON-2424A-0ET
* ISP: Etisalat UAE
* Ports:4 LAN ports
* 2 telephone ports
* 1 fiber WAN port

 ## Access and Configuration
Initially, I had trouble accessing the router's web interface. After some investigation, I found out that this device is heavily customized by the ISP.

## Access Information
After performing a factory reset, I was able to access the router with the following details:
* IP Address: 192.168.1.1
* Username: zhone
* Password: admin

Once logged in, I enabled Telnet and SSH.


## Telnet and SSH Access

Although Telnet and SSH were enabled, I encountered difficulties logging in with several common usernames and passwords. Hereâ€™s what I tried
* :Username: root
* :Password: root (didn't work)
* Other combinations tried:
* root/zhone
* user/user


Eventually, I found a working set of credentials
* :Username: admin
* Password: zhone

 ```
root@kali:-# telnet 192.168.1.1

It seems that the standard Linux root filesystem on this device does not include Dropbear or SSH. Despite thorough checks, I was unable to find any related files.

However, the device runs a custom shell that includes SSH functionality, although it is quite limited and does not support features like SCP.

Upon examining the main /etc/passwd file, I encountered several accounts, including one that was particularly confusing:

* Username: reset2defaults
* Password: F9n8Z/0zN9S1E

The presence of these accounts is unusual and seems to serve different purposes.

 ## Web UI Login Credentials

I have discovered the following login credentials for the web UI:
Manufacturer Accounts & Superadmin
* Username: support
* Password: zhone

Administration (ISP User & Manager Accounts):
* Username: admin
* Password: zhone (Note: This password may be automatically changed by the ISP through their TR-069 server or by a technician)


* Normal Accounts & Users:
* Username: user
* Password: user

## Firmware and Software

This router has a feature for alternative firmware installations. If a new version is loaded, the standard Linux filesystem features might not function as expected because the software development options have been removed.
